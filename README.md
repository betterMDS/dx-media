Description

This package is still under serious development. The goals are for a play-anything (primarily video) play-anywhere media player, including mobile and desktop browsers.

Other "media: includes:

* Slideshow: An iPhone-like photo viewer that works on desktop and mobile
* Virtual Tour: A 360 degree image viewer that works on desktop and mobile
* Image: a wrapper for a standard HTML image file, that always for more versatility such as load and error events, sizing methods, and hiding the loading flash.
* SWF: A loader and wrapper for Flash SWFs. More detail soon.

Video players will include:

* HTML5 desktop
* HTML5 mobile
* Flash
* Silverlight

dx-media replies upon Dojo and Dijit base. It also has two package dependencies: dx-alias and dx-timer.
